  abstract = {This study examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI), Sex, and Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS) performance among low-income rural children aged 5 to 7 years. 39 children (20 boys and 19 girls) participated in the study. FMS proficiency was evaluated using the Furtado-Gallagher Child Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS). The children’s height and weight were measured to calculate BMI, which was then classified into ‘normal weight’ and 'overweight'. A two-way factorial ANOVA assessed the effects of sex and BMI group on manipulative fundamental motor skills (MFMS), locomotor fundamental motor skills (LFMS), and total fundamental motor skills (TFMS). We hypothesized that normal weight children would outperform their overweight counterparts in locomotor (LFMS), manipulative (MFMS), and total (TFMS) fundamental motor skills and that boys would outperform girls on MFMS and TFMS but not on LFMS. Our findings showed a significant main effect of sex on MFMS, with boys performing significantly better than girls. However, no significant main effects were found for LFMS or TFMS based on sex or BMI group. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis revealed weak, negative, non-significant correlations between BMI percentiles and all three motor skill scores. The study’s results highlight the importance of considering sex differences when assessing FMS in children and indicate that overweight status may not necessarily relate to poorer motor skill performance in a rural, low-income context. Further research should ensure a balanced representation across BMI categories and explore the potential influence of demographic factors on motor skill development.},

  abstract = {Mastery of fundamental movement skills (FMS) is an important factor in preventing weight gain and increasing physical activity. To master FMS, performance evaluation is necessary. In this study, we investigated the reliability of a new observational assessment tool. In Phase I, 110 video clips of children performing five locomotor, and six manipulative FMSs were developed. In Phase II, rating scales were developed, and their efficacy was evaluated by comparing judgments of 30 undergraduate students to a standard. The mean weighted kappa (.71) was considered good (range .51-.85). Of the 11 rating scales, 6 were modified, and 5 remained unchanged. This study sets the foundation for the development of a new observational scale to assess fundamental movement skills.},

In Study 1, we found that four of the six scales that underwent modifications in a previous study yielded acceptable expert agreement, permitting their retention in the revised test, while the two remaining scales measuring side sliding and leaping yielded insufficient expert agreement, leading to their removal from the test. In Study 2, weighted kappa values reflected very good interrater agreement among three raters across two test administrations for the Locomotor and Manipulative subtests and the Total score (all skills combined). Future studies should (a) collect validity and reliability evidence for two additional skills planned for inclusion in the Locomotor subtest, (b) assess the impact of varying the number of trials given when assessing motor skill performances in life settings, and (c) test the feasibility of the web-based training tool and mobile version of the instrument., Fundamental movement skills (FMS) play a crucial role in a child’s motor skill development, as their mastery is related to the acquisition and mastery of specialized sport skills and to a child’s general health through the prevention of weight gain and increased level of physical activity.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To verify the association of motor skills with habitual and organized PA participation, and sedentary behavior for males and females. METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional design in a sample of seventy-six second graders from a public elementary school in a Midwestern State. RESULTS: Mann Whitney and t-tests indicated gender differences in FMS and PA variables. Spearman correlation analyses demonstrated that habitual PA was correlated to total FMS, and manipulative skills for boys. For girls, a significant association was present in organized PA and locomotor skills. CONCLUSION: Choice of organized physical activity seems to influence the development of FMS and affect habitual PA behavior differently in boys and girls.},

  abstract = {The Furtado-Gallagher Children Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS) is an observational tool using sequential decisions to assess fundamental movement skill proficiency. The current version of the test has three locomotor and five manipulative skills. Adding two more locomotor skills to the assessment tool enriches its scope, enabling a more comprehensive and nuanced evaluation of individual movement skills. We assessed expert-non-expert rater agreement and inter/intra non-expert rater reliability of two new scales for the locomotor subscale. We divided this study into two parts. In Part I, we filmed 60 children aged 5-10~years old who performed gallop and vertical jump skills. A motor behavior expert then classified the videotapes using our newly created rating scales. Next, we selected eight videos for training purposes and 24 videos for testing purposes. In Part II, 30 undergraduate students underwent rater training. Rating data were analyzed using weighted kappa (Kw) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and these indices showed 'very good' agreement between the expert and the non-expert raters for vertical jump (Kw = .96) and gallop (Kw = .89). The ICC expert to non-expert rater values for vertical jump and gallop were .98 and .94, respectively; and mean kappa values for inter-rater reliability between non-experts were considered 'very good' for vertical jump (MKw = .92) and 'good' for gallop (MKw = .78). The ICC inter-rater values were .98 and .95 (considered 'excellent') for vertical jump and gallop, respectively; and the kappa intra-rater values were .96 and .85, respectively, with intra-rater ICC values .98 and .92. Thus, the proposed rating scales were reliable for assessing vertical jump and gallop. Future studies should focus on criterion-related validity and reliability evidence from live performances.},
