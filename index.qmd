The Children Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System[^1] (FG-COMPASS) is an assessment tool designed to evaluate the proficiency of fundamental movement skills in children between the ages of 5 to 10. It can be utilized in both educational and clinical environments.

[^1]: Formerly known as Furtado-Gallagher **Computerized** Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System.

The tool employs a decision-tree strategy to evaluate proficiency levels of skills. The model framework is illustrated below:

Where,

-   `DQ` is the discriminatory question

-   `UCQ` is the upper confirmatory question

-   `LCQ` is the lower confirmatory question

-   `Levels 1-4` are the resulting proficiency skill levels

The purpose of DQ is to differentiate between the highest and lowest levels, namely levels 1 and 4. UCQ is designed to verify if an individual is at level 4. If UCQ fails to confirm level 4, then the individual is evaluated as level 3. Similarly, LCQ is meant to confirm if an individual is at level 1. If LCQ fails to confirm level 1, then the individual is evaluated as level 2.

Using the framework mentioned earlier, decision-trees were created for 10 movement skills, which include 5 Locomotor and 5 Manipulative skills. Below is an example of the decision-tree for the `Overhand Throw`.
