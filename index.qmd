The Furtado-Gallagher Computerized Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS) is a new tool intended to assess fundamental movement skill proficiency of children 5-10 years old.

The instrument uses a decision-tree approach to assess skill proficiency levels. The framework model is depicted below

    ```{mermaid}
    %%| fig-width: 6.5
    flowchart LR
        A[DQ] --> |YES| B[UCQ]
        B -->|YES| D[Level 4]
        B -->|NO| E[Level 3]
        A[DQ] --> |NO| F[LCQ]
        F -->|YES| G[Level 2]
        F -->|NO| H[Level 1]
    ```

Where,

-   `DQ` is the discriminatory question

-   `UCQ` is the upper confirmatory question

-   `LCQ` is the lower confirmatory question

-   `Levels 1-4` are the resulting proficiency skill levels

The `DQ` is intended to discriminate between the two most extreme levels (i.e., levels `1` and `2`). The `UCQ` is intended to confirm the individual is `level 4`. If it fail to confirm it, then the individual is assessed as `level 3`. Similarly, the `LCQ` is intended to confirm that the individual is `level 1`. if it fails to confirm it, then the individual is assessed as `level 2`.

The framework above was used to create decision-trees for 10 fundamental movement skills (i.e., 5 Locomotor and 5 Manipulative skills). The decision-tree for `Overhand Throw` is presented below.

    ```{mermaid}
    %%| fig-width: 6.5
    flowchart LR
        A[Does the trunk rotate to the side \n of the throw during the \n preparation action?] --> |YES| B[Is there a long \n contralateral step forward?]
        B -->|YES| D[Level 4]
        B -->|NO| E[Level 3]
        A[Does the trunk rotate to the side \n of the throw during the \n preparation action?] --> |NO| F[Is there a step forward \n with either foot?]
        F -->|YES| G[Level 2]
        F -->|NO| H[Level 1]
    ```
