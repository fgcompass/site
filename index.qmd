The Furtado-Gallagher Computerized Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS) is a tool intended to assess fundamental movement skill proficiency of children 5-10 years old. It can be used in clinical or educational settings.

The instrument uses a decision-tree approach to assess skill proficiency levels. The framework model is depicted below:

![Framework model for the decision trees](images/dt-model.png){#fig-dt-model width="100%"}

Where,

-   `DQ` is the discriminatory question

-   `UCQ` is the upper confirmatory question

-   `LCQ` is the lower confirmatory question

-   `Levels 1-4` are the resulting proficiency skill levels

The `DQ` is intended to discriminate between the two most extreme levels (i.e., levels `1` and `2`). The `UCQ` is intended to confirm the individual is `level 4`. If it fail to confirm it, then the individual is assessed as `level 3`. Similarly, the `LCQ` is intended to confirm that the individual is `level 1`. if it fails to confirm it, then the individual is assessed as `level 2`.

The framework above was used to create decision-trees for 10 fundamental movement skills (i.e., 5 Locomotor and 5 Manipulative skills). The decision-tree for `Overhand Throw` is presented below.
