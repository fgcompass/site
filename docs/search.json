The UCQ is intended to confirm the individual is level 4. If it fail to confirm it, then the individual is assessed as level 3. Similarly, the LCQ is intended to confirm that the individual is level 1. if it fails to confirm it, then the individual is assessed as level 2.\nThe framework above was used to create decision-trees for 10 fundamental movement skills (i.e., 5 Locomotor and 5 Manipulative skills).
