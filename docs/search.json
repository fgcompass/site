    "text": "The Children Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System1 (FG-COMPASS) is an assessment tool designed to evaluate the proficiency of fundamental movement skills in children between the ages of 5 to 10. It can be utilized in both educational and clinical environments.\nThe tool employs a decision-tree strategy to evaluate proficiency levels of skills. The model framework is illustrated below:\nWhere,\nThe purpose of DQ is to differentiate between the highest and lowest levels, namely levels 1 and 4. UCQ is designed to verify if an individual is at level 4. If UCQ fails to confirm level 4, then the individual is evaluated as level 3. Similarly, LCQ is meant to confirm if an individual is at level 1. If LCQ fails to confirm level 1, then the individual is evaluated as level 2.\nUsing the framework mentioned earlier, decision-trees were created for 10 movement skills, which include 5 Locomotor and 5 Manipulative skills. Below is an example of the decision-tree for the Overhand Throw.",
